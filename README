Server.py listens for incoming licensing requests from the licensing-portal TurboGears2
website. The plain text license request recieved from licensing-portal is sent to 
license-generator via subprocoess. The encypted hex output of license-generator is sent 
back to the licensing-portal and stored in the database.
